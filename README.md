## How to Use This Repository

1. **Clone the Repository:** To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mo-Xiyad/basic-teaching.git
   ```

## Running the Code

To run the TypeScript code examples in this repo, follow these steps:

- **Install TypeScript:** If you haven't already installed TypeScript globally on your system, you can do so using npm (Node Package Manager). Open your terminal and run

  ```bash
  npm install -g typescript
  ```

- **Compile TypeScript to JavaScript:** In the functions folder, run the following command to transpile the functions.ts file to JavaScript:

        ```bash
        tsc functions.ts
        ```

  This will create a functions.js file in the same directory.

- **Run the JavaScript File:** Finally, run the JavaScript file using Node.js:

  ```bash
  node functions.js
  ```
````
